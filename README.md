This project analyzes sales data using SQLite and visualizes revenue by product with a bar chart in Python.

## 📁 Project Files

- `sales_data.db` – SQLite database with sample sales records.
- `task7_script.py.ipynb` – Python script to create the table, insert data, query results, and plot the chart.
- `sales_chart.png` – Output image showing revenue per product.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Query total quantity and revenue by product
- Print a summary
